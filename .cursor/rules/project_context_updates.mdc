# Project Context Update Rule

After any **confirmed** file change (code/config/docs), you MUST update `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`:

- Add a dated entry under **Changelog**
- Include **why**, **what changed**, **files touched**, and **how to test**
- Note any **gotchas** or follow-ups

If the change is safety/security-related (credentials, auth, DRY_RUN, execution), call it out explicitly in the changelog entry.
